DeltaX Project by Tal Saban

* Overview:
  DeltaX is a Python-based security tool designed to monitor changes in Windows Registry Editor keys, providing an efficient way to detect indicators of compromise (IoC). The tool tracks registry modifications in real-time and identifies any newly added registry values.

* Files:
- Config.txt:
  Contains the list of registry keys to be scanned.
- BaseLine.txt:
  Stores data about previous and current registry values, serving as a reference point for detecting changes.

* How It Works:
- Registry Key Selection:
  DeltaX determines which registry keys to scan by reading the Config.txt file.
- Scanning:
  The tool scans the specified keys in the Windows Registry Editor for any changes.
- Delta Calculation:
  Compares the newly scanned registry values against the data stored in BaseLine.txt to calculate the Delta (changes).
- Baseline Update:
  Allows the client to update the BaseLine.txt file based on the detected changes.

* Key Features:
- Tracks registry modifications in real time.
- Detects new registry values that may indicate a potential compromise.
- Configurable scanning via a simple Config.txt file.
- Logs and reports detected changes for further analysis.
